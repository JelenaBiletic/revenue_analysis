# **Unicorn: Sales and Profit Analysis**
### **Executive Summary**
## **INTRODUCTION**
This document presents a comprehensive analysis of Unicorn Company's sales data, identifying key trends and critical areas of concern. Specifically, it examines the issue of declining profits in the face of consistent sales growth. Along with this analysis, we provide actionable recommendations designed to reverse the downward profit trend. Our objective is to deliver a clear, data-driven foundation that supports informed decision-making and fosters sustainable profitability.
## **METHODOLOGY**
The analysis was divided into three key areas: **sales and profit analysis**, **customer behavior**, and **product performance**. Each of these areas was approached using a combination of data extraction, transformation, and visualization tools.
By combining **SQL** and **Google Sheets** for data extraction and preparation, and **Tableau** for visualization, we were able to conduct a thorough analysis of Unicorn Company's sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

## **KEY FINDINGS**
**Profit and Sales Trends**
Sales have shown a consistent linear growth over the years, indicating stable demand for Unicorn Company's products. However, despite this growth, profits have experienced a notable decline in the past year. A key factor contributing to this is the steady increase in product costs, which has outpaced the growth in sales. Specifically, the Furniture Category has been a major area of concern, recording a loss in 2018. Most products in this category continue to incur significant losses, and the data reveals that no product in this category sells more than eight units per year. This suggests low customer interest and challenges the profitability of the Furniture Category.

**Impact of Discounts on Sales and Profits**
The analysis also highlights the adverse impact of high discounts on both sales volume and profitability. Across all product categories and customer segments, higher discounts are associated with a reduction in sales volume. This counterintuitive trend suggests that discounts may not be attracting more customers and could be eroding profit margins. Furthermore, higher discounts have a clear correlation with reduced profits, compounding the issue across the board.

**Geographic Distribution of Sales and Profit**
Geographically, the company's sales and profit distribution is highly concentrated. California and New York stand out as the only states reporting profits exceeding $70,000, followed by Washington with a profit of $33,390. In contrast, all other states either report profits below $30,000 or incur losses, indicating uneven market performance across regions. This highlights the need for a more targeted approach to improving profitability in underperforming states.
## **RECOMMENDATIONS**
**Strategy 1: Cost Optimization and Product Alignment**
* **Cost Optimization:** Review and streamline operational costs to reduce unnecessary expenses.
* **Product Portfolio:** Discontinue underperforming products, focusing on those with higher potential.
* **Market Research:** Understand customer preferences and adjust offerings accordingly.
* **Quality Improvement:** Enhance product quality and introduce innovations to stand out from competitors.
* **Financial Monitoring:** Implement stricter financial monitoring to quickly address profitability challenges.
  
**Strategy 2: Customer and Competitive Insight**
* **Customer Survey:** Survey customers to understand why discounts aren't driving sales and what factors influence their buying behavior.
* **Competitive Benchmarking:** Analyze competitor discount strategies to better align and compete in the market.
  
**Strategy 3: Regional Market Focus**
* **Analyze Success:** Study California and New York to understand the factors behind their success.
* **Tailored Marketing:** Create region-specific campaigns and promotions to engage underperforming markets.
* **Community Engagement:** Build local relationships through partnerships and community activities.
